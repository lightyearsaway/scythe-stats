# Overview

Scythe Stats (also known as Beloved Pacifist), hosted on scythestats.com (and belovedpacifist.com),
is a site created to aggregate and showcase stats for the board game Scythe, by Stonemaier Games.

Currently, these stats are aggregated from the Scythe Discord, in its #vanilla-win-stats channel.
These, for the most part, feature Tabletop Simulator games. Perhaps there will be some way to integrate
with the Digital Edition in the future.

The repository consists of three main parts - the API, the Discord bot (that collects stats), and the frontend.
You are free to make PRs, post issues, ask for feature requests, etc. as you wish. Although, I don't have
instructions for getting a solid development environment set up yet.

If you're interested in design, I'd be open to talk as well. The site's design is mostly hacked up
by me as a byproduct of trying some random handful of things (and in some parts, the code probably shows :)).

# FAQ

### Are new features coming to the site?

New features will be coming to the site as (and if) we collect enough data for this stuff to be interesting.
The current site remains somewhat minimal for the sake of showing what information I currently think is worth showing.

### You don't protect your logging with x/y/z!

Yes - these logs are collected from Discord with no verification that players' matches occurred or
played out in the way they did. I have no reasonable way of telling right from wrong (if someone does, let me know),
and so I do not intend on being able to control malicious intent in the meantime (although moderators in the Discord
would probably ban/delete those with malicious intent).


(it's a fun board game with a site developed by free time - if you want to be malicious, well...)
